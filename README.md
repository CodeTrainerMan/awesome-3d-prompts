English | [中文](README_ZH.md)

---

An open-source project for collecting high-quality 3D generation prompts.

## 📖 Introduction

This project is dedicated to collecting and organizing excellent 3D generation prompts, helping 3D creators, designers, and developers quickly find suitable prompts to improve 3D content generation efficiency.

## 🎯 Goals

- Collect high-quality and practical 3D generation prompts
- Provide prompt classifications in different styles
- Continuously update and maintain the prompt library
- Provide references and inspiration for 3D content generation

## 🔄 Generation Workflows

### 1. Prompt → Image → 3D

Two-stage workflow: generate images first, then convert to 3D models.

**Image Generation Tools**:
- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)
- [Grok](https://x.ai/)
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)

**Image to 3D Tools**:
- [Stable Point Aware 3D](https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-point-aware-3d)
- [Tripo AI](https://www.tripo3d.ai/)

### 2. Prompt → 3D

Direct generation from text prompts to 3D models.

**Tools**:
- [Tripo AI](https://www.tripo3d.ai/)
