He wears a custom, form-fitting Iron Man suit with a sharp, angular design inspired by the Tesla Cybertruck, made of polished red and brushed silver geometric plates. A prominent "TESLA" logo is visibly placed on the thigh armor plates. A clear "SPACEX" logo is on the bicep armor. No excess bulk. His helmet is held at his side. Even, neutral cinematic lighting to show contours, ultra-detailed texture, realistic, 8k --ar 2:3
